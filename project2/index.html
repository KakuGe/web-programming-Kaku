 				<h3 style="color:salmon;">Gameplay</h3>
				<p style="color:black;font family: sans-serif; font-size:20px;"> Like its predecessors, <i>Splatoon 3</i> is a third-person shooter. Players choose to be either an "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkling_(Splatoon)
					">Inkling</a>" or "Octoling" as their player character. Both wield weaponry that shoots colored ink. Weapons are diverse in ability and imagery, with most resembling household objects. For example, Rollers are large paint rollers that can cover large amounts of area in ink but are generally limited to close-range combat. At the same time, Chargers are sniper rifle-like weapons with a long range for sniping opponents but are less effective at painting the ground. <i>Splatoon 3</i> expands upon this by adding new main and special weapons to the game.Inklings and Octolings also have the ability to morph into squid or octopus form, referred to as the "swim form" which can be used to climb ink-covered walls or swim through ink faster than the humanoid forms can walk.Weapons have a finite amount of ink ammunition, and submerging in ink via the swim form replenishes it quicker than in humanoid form. All basic weapons from the prior <i>Splatoon</i> games return in <i>Splatoon 3 </i>.

			</p> <p style="color:black;font family: sans-serif; font-size:20px;"> Returning from its predecessor as a playable online multiplayer game mode is Regular Battle, known as Turf War. In Regular Battles, two teams of four players compete to cover the most amount of the map's area in their respective ink color. Each team can cover over an area covered by the opponents with their color in return, and the opposing team's ink slows movement, gradually deals damage and prevents the use of the player's swim form. Each player is equipped with a weapon set, chosen before each match, and each set comes with additional secondary and special weapons in addition to its main weapon. Secondary weapons provide alternate forms of attacking the other team and inking the ground; for example, Splat Bombs that explode a second after contact with a surface and Burst Bombs that explode upon impact. When enough ground is covered in a player's ink, they may use a special weapon, which are primarily used to attack the opposing team. Weapons and other forms of attack can deal damage to opposing players; when enough damage is given, they will "splat" their opponent, forcing them to restart from their starting location. Matches last three minutes, and whichever team covers a higher percentage of the field at the end of the match is declared the winner.</p>

			</p> <p style="color:black;font family: sans-serif; font-size:20px;">The game also features monthly "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Splatfest">Splatfests</a>", where players choose to join one of three teams (compared to two in the previous two games) over a particular theme and over two days engage in matches to gain the most points for victory. The Salmon Run co-op mode is also returning, being titled "Salmon Run Next Wave".The main <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overworld">hub</a> of <i>Splatoon 3</i> is known as "Splatsville", nicknamed "the city of chaos", and is located in a different region from the previous two games' hub of "Inkopolis" known as "the Splatlands".

 			</div>
			<div id="section3">
 				<h3 style="color:salmon;">Plot</h3>
				<p style="color:black;font family: sans-serif; font-size:20px";>The <i>Splatoon</i> games take place on a version of Earth set far in the future after the extinction of humanity, where much ocean life has evolved to live on land. <i>Splatoon 3</i> takes place 5 years after the events of <i><a href="/wiki/Splatoon_2" title="Splatoon 2">Splatoon 2</a></i> in the Splatlands, a sun-scorched desert inhabited by battle-hardened Inklings and Octolings, and Splatsville, a city of chaos that seems to have developed rapidly since the last Splatfest, Chaos vs. Order.
		</p>

				<h4 style="color:salmon;font family: sans-serif";><span>Return of the Mammalians</span></span> </h4>
			    <p style="color:black;font family: sans-serif; font-size:20px;">Upon following the elderly squid Cap'n Cuttlefish down a sewer, the player and their Smallfry friend (also known as "Little Buddy") find themselves in a crater covered with a lethal, fuzzy ooze and must fight Octarians covered in fur; Smallfry is able to eat and destroy some of the ooze. Cuttlefish enlists the player as Agent 3 of the New Squidbeak Splatoon and tasks them with recovering the once-again-missing Great Zapfish, which powers Splatsville. As they travel down the crater, they attempt to contact Squid Sisters Callie and Marie to pick them up. However, their conversation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiretapping">wiretapped</a> by Octarian leader DJ Octavio, who accuses Cuttlefish of taking his Octarian warriors and denies taking the Zapfish. The ground breaks open, sending Agent 3 and Smallfry falling into the remains of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_city">underground city </a>, also covered with the fuzzy ooze and containing a massive rocket at the center. They meet Callie, Marie, and the Captain (the protagonist of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splatoon_(video_game)"> the first game  </a>), who ask them to explore the city and find Cuttlefish. Aided by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> called O.R.C.A, they explore the city, which the fuzzy Octarians have turned into a base. They are forced at times to fight the Splatlands idols, Deep Cut, who claim the city contains valuable treasure (which appears to be nothing but piles of junk) and want it for themselves. As Agent 3 explores, they discover that Cuttlefish has been captured by Grizzco CEO Mr. Grizz, who has also stolen the Zapfish and the Octarian army.
					</p><p style="color:black;font family: sans-serif; font-size:20px;"> The New Squidbeak Splatoon deduces that Cuttlefish must be on the rocket and constructs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawnmower">lawnmower</a> using the treasures, which they use to cut the fuzzy ooze around the rocket. Deep Cut, who had been searching for the treasure to help out the citizens of Splatsville, are given the treasure as the New Squidbeak Splatoon no longer needs it and they form an alliance with the New Squidbeak Splatoon and becomes the Squid Sisters' employees. Agent 3 climbs the rocket, reaching a dehydrated and dead Cuttlefish and Mr. Grizz, who is revealed to be a massive bear and the only remaining mammal on the planet. Grizz explains that, powered by the Great Zapfish and golden salmon eggs, the rocket is rigged to explode and cover the entire Earth in fuzzy ooze. While Cuttlefish is revived in primitive squid form by the Captain's tears, Grizz launches the rocket, but Deep Cut provides Agent 3 a lift onto it with help from their tamed eels and sharks. Agent 3 and Smallfry defeat Mr. Grizz, who attempts to crash into the planet as a last-ditch effort. However, DJ Octavio arrives in an upgraded mech and assists Agent 3 in vacuuming up the fuzzy ooze while Smallfry grows into a "Hugefry" and battles Mr. Grizz atop the rocket. Agent 3 ultimately defeats Grizz and destroys the rocket with a massive blast of Grizz's own fuzzy ooze, leaving him to accept defeat before the rocket explodes. Agent 3, Smallfry, and Octavio return to Earth with the Great Zapfish, and Deep Cut continues working with the Squid Sisters and premiering their latest single. During the credits, Grizz is shown to have survived and is seen floating in space.
